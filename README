= cmess - Assist with handling messed up encodings

== VERSION

This documentation refers to cmess version 0.4.0


== DESCRIPTION

CMess bundles several tools under its hood that aim at dealing with various
problems occurring in the context of character sets and encodings. Currently,
there are:

+guess_encoding+::  Simple helper to identify the encoding of a given string.
                    Includes the ability to automatically detect the encoding
                    of an input. (see CMess::GuessEncoding)
+cinderella+::      When characters are "double encoded", you can't easily
                    convert them back -- this is where cinderella comes in,
                    sorting the good ones into the pot and the (potentially)
                    bad ones into the crop... (see CMess::Cinderella)
+bconv+::           Convert between bibliographic (and other) encodings.
                    (see CMess::BConv)
+decode_entities+:: Decode HTML entities in a string. (see CMess::DecodeEntities)


== SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

Requires Ruby version 1.9.2 or higher; use the latest 0.3.x release on older
Ruby versions. CMess has been tested with ruby 2.0.0p247 on x86_64-linux.
